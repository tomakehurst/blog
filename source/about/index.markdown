This is Tom Akehurst's software development blog.

I'm interested in agile, lean, DevOps and Continuous Delivery, amongst others. I mostly program in Java, despite the stigma, but regularly dabble in other high level languages including Python, JavaScript and Clojure. 

You can find me on [GitHub](https://github.com/tomakehurst) and occasionally on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/TomAkehurst).
