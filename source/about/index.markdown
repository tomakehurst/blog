This is Tom Akehurst's software development blog.

Over the last decade or so I've been a developer, app support lead, scrum master and architect. I'm a strong advocate of agile, DevOps and Continuous Delivery practices, and am usually focussed on improving team performance and building operable, sustainable systems. 

I mostly program in Java (despite the stigma) but regularly dabble in other high-level languages including Python, JavaScript and Clojure. Lately I've started doing an almost passable sysadmin impression, mostly with Linux, Puppet and Bash.

I made, and maintain [WireMock](http://wiremock.org).
