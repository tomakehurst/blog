This is Tom Akehurst's blog.

I'm a software developer with interests in agile and lean, DevOps and Continuous Delivery, and developer productivity, amongst others. I mostly program in Java, despite the stigma, but regularly dabble in other high level languages including Python, JavaScript and Clojure. 

I've led agile projects, worn a scrum master hat on occasion, and helped teams bring DevOps and CD practices to life.
